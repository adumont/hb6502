# Introduction

This project is about building a single board 65c02 computer.

It's powered by a WDC 65C02s CPU driven by a 1.8432MHz oscillator clock, with 32KB of SRAM (only 16K used), 32K of ROM, a 65c22 VIA interface, a 6551 ACIA serial interface, and an 20x4 LCD screen.

The ROM is programmed using my self-made [EEPROM programmer](programmer/README.md).

## Memory Map

The address decoding logic is following the one described by Garth Wilson in his [6502 Primer, Address decoding](https://wilsonminesco.com/6502primer/addr_decoding.html) page. The corresponding schematics is:

| Address       | Component  |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| `$0000-$3FFF` | RAM (16KB) |
| `$4200-$4203` | ACIA       |
| `$6000-$600F` | VIA        |
| `$8000-$FFFF` | ROM (32KB) |

# Software

## Monitor

At the moment the monitor is very rudimentary, but it serves its purpose.

Monitor will show content at ADDR. You can type:
- a new ADDR (4 char, hex): this will set ADDR to the new value, and display the content. For ex. `04F0`
- a value (2 char, hex): this will store the value at ADDR. For ex. `FB`
- `'` followed by a char: store the char at ADDR. For ex. `'A`
- `j` restore registers to saved values and jump to ADDR
- `c` continue (after a BRK). restore registers to saved values, set ADDR to saved PC (after BRK) and jump to ADDR

Registers manipulation (saved values):
- `aXX` : store XX (hex) in A
- `xXX` : store XX (hex) in X
- `yXX` : store XX (hex) in Y
- `sXX` : store XX (hex) in S
- `pXX` : store XX (hex) in P
- `r`   : print registers value

## FORTH

I have implemented my own FORTH kernel for this Homebrew 6502.
